# hw6-weather-dashboard

## **Project Description**

For this project we wre tasked with creating a weather dashboard that correctly displayed the weather depending on what city a user searched for. We were tasked with the following assingments:

* When a user seraches for a city, they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
* When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with the city name, the date, an icon indicating the weather conditoins, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.
* When the UV index is viewed the user is presented with a color that indicates the weather conditions as favorable, moderate, or severe.
* There is a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon repersentation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.
* When a user clicks on a city in the search history, they are again presented with the current and future conditions for that city.
* When the page is refreshed, the saved data persists
